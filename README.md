# Project 2 - IMDb Movies Data Analysis

## About the Project
In this project, I analyzez a dataset and communicated my findings about it. I used the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to do the analysis

This Python script is written for Project 3 of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree (DAND) and is used to explore IMDb movie data. But what determines if a movie is considered as good or bad? There could be several factors influencig the quality of a movie, as for example the budget, genre, etc. This little project helped the author to improve his data analytics skills and explore some of the success criteria for movies.

First some Data Wrangling was applied, before the data was cleaned in order to perform Exploratory Data Analysis.

### What I learnt?

After completing the project, I have learned following :

- Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
- Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
- Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
- Have practice communicating the results of your analysis
- Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
- Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
- Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings

### Prerequisites

 - Web browser (Google Chrome recommended)
 - Anaconda (for reading iPython files efficiently)
 - Required libraries installed

### Installing

- [Web Browser]([https://www.google.com/chrome/](https://www.google.com/chrome/))
- [Anaconda]([https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/))
- For installing the libraries 
	After installing anaconda, run `anaconda command prompt`. By default you will be in the base environment. You can either create your own envoronment or install required libraries in the base.
	Commands: `conda install numpy pandas matplotlib`

### Break down into end to end tests

In the notebook, Go to `Cell` and press `Run All`
If all the code ran without erros, you have done everything correctly.

### And coding style tests

Follow the [documentation]([https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development_guide/coding_style.html](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development_guide/coding_style.html)) for coding styles required in python notebooks.

## Deployment

The browser running the notebook is the live deployment of the entire code. You can edit it and have fun with it.

#### Anaconda
This is recommended to be installed for managing the iPython files efficiently
When we launch the `jupyter notebook` from the anaconda prompt, we are automacially redirected to the browser where we can find the files.

## Built With

 - [iPython]([https://ipython.org/](https://ipython.org/)) - This is the file conaining all the python codes. We can make separate blocks of iPython for performing separate tasks. File extension is `.ipynb`
- [Anaconda]([https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)) - [Anaconda Distribution](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/) is the easiest way to perform Python/R data science and machine learning on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. With over 11 million users worldwide, it is the industry standard for developing, testing, and training on a single machine.
